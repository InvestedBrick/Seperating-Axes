This was supposed to become a playground for reinforcement learning agents to learn about deep Q learning.

Then I realised a bit too late that by potato of a PC can't even handle image recognition...

Maybe I will pick up this project in the future again

## Running
install the requirements from requirements.txt (currently just pygame) and then run `python main.py`

## Set up virtual python environment:
`python3 -m venv <path/to/this/dir>`


`source <path/to/this/dir>/bin/activate`
